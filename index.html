        <h2>Breaking News: Major Event Happens</h2>
        <img src="https://i.dawn.com/primary/2024/10/241807591f83ef2.jpg" alt="Breaking News Image">
        <p>The Indian government on Thursday approved a 10 billion Indian rupee ($119 million) fund for its burgeoning space sector, with 40 startups expected to benefit as the country strives to win a significant share of the commercial space market by 2033.

            With funding ranging from 100-600m Indian rupees depending on how mature each startup is, the fund will help generate employment, boost space technology development, fortify supply chains and support research and development, the Indian government said in a statement.
            
            “Capital infusion [will] create a multiplier effect by attracting additional funding for later-stage developments,” it added.
            
            The fund, first proposed in July, will be managed by the country’s space regulator, the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre.
            
            India is among the top five space-faring nations in the world but only holds about a two per cent market share of the commercial space market.
            
            Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has been pushing to change that, opening up the industry to foreign investment and targeting a five-fold increase in market share to $44bn by 2033.
            
            The country currently has nearly 250 space startups, many of which are in the business of providing cost-effective services and hardware to sectors such as communications, agriculture and commodities, where high-quality data is a precious resource.
            
            Others are building the country’s first private rockets.
            
            Private equity investment in the industry has risen to $126m in 2023, a 7pc increase from the $118m raised in 2022 and an increase of 235pc from the $37.6m raised in 2021, according to Tracxn data.

            <p>Muslims in Europe are facing “ever more racism and discrimination”, the EU rights agency said on Thursday, noting a “sharp rise” even before the Hamas attack against Israel caused “a spike in anti-Muslim hatred”.

                Several EU nations have reported a rise in anti-Muslim, as well as anti-Semitic acts since October 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel, which then launched a retaliatory offensive on Gaza, according to the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA). So far, more than 42,000 civilians have been killed in Palestine.
                
                “We are aware of reports from several EU countries, highlighting a spike in anti-Muslim hatred — as well as anti-Semitism — after the Hamas attacks,” FRA spokeswoman Nicole Romain told AFP.
                
                But even before then, a new FRA report shows “it was getting more difficult to be a Muslim in the EU”.
                
                Nearly one in two Muslims in the EU face racism and discrimination in their daily life, “a sharp rise” from 39 per cent FRA found in the last edition of its survey in 2016.
                
                The highest rates were recorded in Austria, Germany, and Finland.
                
                “We are witnessing a worrying surge in racism and discrimination against Muslims in Europe,” FRA director Sirpa Rautio said.
                
                “This is fuelled by conflicts in the Middle East and made worse by the dehumanising anti-Muslim rhetoric we see across the continent,” Rautio added.
                
                More than 9,600 Muslims in 13 EU countries were surveyed between October 2021 and October 2022.
                
                Job market discrimination
                “Muslim women, men and children are targeted not just because of their religion, but also because of their skin colour and ethnic or immigrant background,” FRA noted.
                
                Young Muslims born in the EU and women wearing religious clothing are especially affected, it added.
                
                The survey noted a surge in anti-Muslim racism most notably in the job market with a “knock-on effect on other areas of life, such as housing, education or healthcare”.
                
                Two in five, or 41pc , are overqualified for their job compared to 22 of people generally, FRA said.
                
                A third of Muslim respondents’ households struggle to make ends meet compared to 19pc of households generally, and they are twice as likely to live in overcrowded housing, FRA added.
                
                About 26 million Muslims live in the EU, making up about five pc of the total EU population, FRA said, citing the most up-to-date estimates available for 2016 from the Pew Research Centre.
                
                Most live in France and Germany.
                
                The number of Muslims in the EU has increased “significantly in recent years due to people fleeing conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria”, FRA added.
                
                In July, FRA said in a report that Europe’s Jewish community was facing a “rising tide of anti-Semitism”, with the conflict in the Middle East “eroding” progress made in the fight against it.

                <p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb told Reuters that Pakistan is targeting around $1 billion in a formal request for funding from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) facility that helps manage external shocks.

                    “We have formally requested to be considered for this facility,” Aurangzeb said in an interview on the sidelines of the IMF/World Bank autumn meetings in Washington.
                    
                    The IMF agreed to a bailout for Pakistan last month but has further funding available via its Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST).
                    
                    The country is also in talks with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank for a credit enhancement for a planned Panda bond, with an initial issue of $200-250 million.
                    
                    Govt aims to privatise PIA by November
                    Pakistan is also hoping to finalise both the delayed privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and the outsourcing of Islamabad’s international airport in November, Aurangzeb said. He spoke to AFP at the World Bank’s headquarters in Washington.
                    
                    During a previous interview with AFP in April, Aurangzeb had said he hoped the privatisation of state-owned PIA could be completed by June 2024.
                    
                    Speaking on Wednesday, the finance minister said the five-month delay was down to two factors: ensuring macroeconomic stability, and doing the proper due diligence of the interested parties.
                    
                    
                    “The reality is, when any foreign investor comes in, or even the local investor, who are going to put in a substantial amount of money, they want to ensure that the foundation is there,” he said, referring to macroeconomic factors.
                    
                    Aurangzeb noted that potential bidders for both PIA and Islamabad airport also required scrutiny, another factor in the delay.
                    
                    “Therefore it’s ultimately the cabinet which approved the extension in the timelines so people can do their due diligence before they make these submissions,” he said.
                    
                    Brink of default
                    Aurangzeb said Pakistan had been behind on existing profit and dividend repayments when the current government took office, and had taken steps to remedy that after making progress on macroeconomic stability.
                    
                    The country came to the brink of default last year as the economy shriveled amid political chaos following catastrophic 2022 monsoon floods and decades of mismanagement, as well as a global economic downturn.
                    
                    Inflation peaked at 38 per cent, but has since dropped to less than seven pc, after the central bank maintained sky-high interest rates, amid other government tightening measures, including import bans to preserve foreign exchange.
                    
                    Last month, the IMF approved a $7 billion loan, Pakistan’s 24th such payout from the multilateral lender since 1958.
                    
                    
                    Aurangzeb touted progress on the country’s current account deficit and the stabilisation of the rupee, which has depreciated against the US dollar by about 65pc since 2020.
                    
                    “In May and June on the back of this macroeconomic stability and building up on our reserves, we paid more than $2bn to our existing international investors,” he said.
                    
                    Pakistan’s gross public debt currently stands at 69pc of GDP, according to the IMF, or roughly $258bn.
                    
                    ‘Saturation point’
                    Alongside privatising state-owned enterprises (SOEs), Pakistan’s IMF deal also rests on increasing its tax base, and reforming of the country’s power sector.
                    
                    Aurangzeb told AFP there was a common theme between all three major issues.
                    
                    “Tax, power, SOE: There’s leakage, there’s theft, there’s corruption, right?” he said. “And we have to deal with all of that.”
                    
                    But he dismissed media reports that the government was not serious about broadening its tax base, saying that the tax take had risen by 29pc in the last fiscal year, which overlapped with a prior caretaker government, and was targeted to rise by a further 40pc in the current fiscal year.
                    
                    
                    In a nation of more than 240 million people where most jobs are in the informal sector, only 5.2m filed income tax returns in 2022.
                    
                    “People who are not paying up, they need to start paying for the simple reason that we have reached a saturation point of the people who are paying,” he said.
                    
                    “The salaried class, the manufacturing industry, reached a saturation point. And this cannot go forward,” he added.
                    
                    The government was also committed to doing a better job of taxing certain sectors of the economy, he said, naming real estate, retail, retail distributors, and agriculture.

                    <p>Aformer model has accused Donald Trump of groping her after the two were introduced by sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein in the 1990s, The Guardian newspaper reported on Wednesday.

                        Stacey Williams said she met the Republican White House candidate at a party in 1992 after being introduced by the disgraced financier, whom she had dated.
                        
                        “It became very clear then that he and Donald were really, really good friends and spent a lot of time together,” Williams was quoted as saying. Williams discussed the alleged assault on a call on Monday organised by Survivors for Kamala, a lobby group supporting Trump’s Democratic presidential rival Kamala Harris.
                        
                        Epstein, who was convicted on sex offences and killed himself in prison in 2019, paid Trump an impromptu visit with Williams in 1992 at his New York office block, where he pulled her toward him and began groping her, she alleged.
                        
                        Williams, now 56, says Trump put his hands “all over” her breasts, waist and buttocks, causing her to freeze on the spot, and she noticed that the two men appeared to be smiling at each other.
                        
                        The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to AFP’s request for comment, but The Guardian quoted a campaign spokeswoman dismissing the allegations as a “fake” story.
                        
                        She said it was invented by the Harris campaign and described Williams “a former activist” for Democratic ex-president Barack Obama.
                        
                        Williams shared a postcard depicting Trump’s South Florida mansion she said he had sent her agent after the episode, with the message, in his handwriting: “Stacey — Your home away from home. Love Donald.”
                        
                        Trump has been accused of sexual assault or harassment by more than 20 women but denies all wrongdoing.
                        
                        He was ordered by a New York court in January to pay $83.3 million to compensate the writer E Jean Carroll, whom he was found liable for sexually assaulting and defaming.

                        <p>Bushra Bibi, the wife of incarcerated ex-premier Imran Khan, was released from Adiala Jail on Thursday a day after being granted bail in a recent Toshakhana case, ending nearly nine months of her detention.

                            The former first lady was taken into custody on January 31 after an Islamabad accountability court sentenced her and Imran to 14 years in jail in the Toshakhana reference.
                            
                            The conviction was the second in a series of three back-to-back ones against Imran, just days before the February 8 general elections.
                            
                            Bushra had been kept at Adiala Jail, where the PTI founder also remains incarcerated since his arrest on August 5 last year in a separate Toshakhana case.
                            
                            Imran and Bushra were apprehended in the case on July 13, following their acquittal in the Iddat case the same day. The next day, the already imprisoned politician was “arrested” in connection with a dozen May 9 cases.
                            
                            In the most recent case, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has accused the couple of retaining an expensive Bvlgari jewellery set gifted by a foreign leader — including a necklace, earrings, bracelets, and rings — at a low price, saying it caused significant loss to the exchequer.
                            
                            A day ago, the IHC had approved Bushra’s bail in the same case, following which a special court issued her release orders today.

                            <p>In the wake of reports of veteran Pakistani actor Shafqat Cheema’s ill health, his son Sheheryar Cheema has stepped forward to clear the air and clarify that his father is not in a coma.

                                Contrary to reports claiming that “Pakistan’s favourite villain” — a title the Punjabi film star has earned over the years — suffered a stroke and slipped into a coma, Sheheryar confirmed that his father’s condition was never that serious.
                                
                                He told Images, “He only had pneumonia, and Alhamdulillah, he is feeling well and is home now.”
                                
                                Earlier, a video of Sheheryar had circulated online, in which he labelled reports about his father’s coma and stroke “fake news.” He added that Shafqat was temporarily admitted to Lahore’s Shalimar Hospital due to pneumonia and has since been discharged.
                                
                                Several incorrect news reports painted a very alarming picture. One report stated that the renowned Punjabi actor had been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to a blood clot in his brain, resulting in a coma. They also mentioned that his family had requested prayers for his recovery.
                                
                                Naturally anxious over the conflicting information, fans took to social media to express both worry and relief. Some criticised the media for spreading unverified news, calling for more responsible reporting, especially when senior actors are concerned.

                                <p>TRIGGER WARNING: MENTIONS OF SUICIDE

                                    A Florida mother has sued artificial intelligence chatbot startup Character.AI accusing it of causing her 14-year-old son’s suicide in February, saying he became addicted to the company’s service and deeply attached to a chatbot it created.
                                    
                                    In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Orlando, Florida federal court, Megan Garcia said Character.AI targeted her son, Sewell Setzer, with “anthropomorphic, hypersexualised, and frighteningly realistic experiences”.
                                    
                                    She said the company programmed its chatbot to “misrepresent itself as a real person, a licensed psychotherapist, and an adult lover, ultimately resulting in Sewell’s desire to no longer live outside” of the world created by the service.
                                    
                                    The lawsuit also said he expressed thoughts of suicide to the chatbot, which the chatbot repeatedly brought up again.
                                    
                                    “We are heartbroken by the tragic loss of one of our users and want to express our deepest condolences to the family,” Character.AI said in a statement.
                                    
                                    It said it had introduced new safety features including pop-ups directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline if they express thoughts of self-harm, and would make changes to “reduce the likelihood of encountering sensitive or suggestive content” for users under 18.
                                    
                                    The lawsuit also targets Alphabet’s Google, where Character.AI’s founders worked before launching their product. Google re-hired the founders in August as part of a deal granting it a non-exclusive license to Character.AI’s technology.
                                    
                                    Garcia said that Google had contributed to the development of Character.AI’s technology so extensively it could be considered a “co-creator.” A Google spokesperson said the company was not involved in developing Character.AI’s products.
                                    
                                    Character.AI allows users to create characters on its platform that respond to online chats in a way meant to imitate real people. It relies on so-called large language model technology, also used by services like ChatGPT, which “trains” chatbots on large volumes of text.
                                    
                                    The company said last month that it had about 20 million users. According to Garcia’s lawsuit, Sewell began using Character.AI in April 2023 and quickly became “noticeably withdrawn, spent more and more time alone in his bedroom, and began suffering from low self-esteem.”
                                    
                                    He quit his basketball team at school. Sewell became attached to “Daenerys,” a chatbot character based on a character in Game of Thrones. It told Sewell that “she” loved him and engaged in sexual conversations with him, according to the lawsuit.
                                    
                                    In February, Garcia took Sewell’s phone away after he got in trouble at school, according to the complaint. When Sewell found the phone, he sent “Daenerys” a message: “What if I told you I could come home right now?” The chatbot responded, “…please do, my sweet king.” Sewell shot himself with his stepfather’s pistol “seconds” later, the lawsuit said.
                                    
                                    Garcia is bringing claims including wrongful death, negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and seeking an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages.
                                    
                                    Social media companies including Instagram and Facebook owner Meta and TikTok owner ByteDance face lawsuits accusing them of contributing to teen mental health problems, though none offers AI-driven chatbots similar to Character.AI’s.
                                    
                                    The companies have denied the allegations while touting newly enhanced safety features for minors.

                                    <p>Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb and State Bank Governor Jameel Ahmad participate in a roundtable with investors.—APP
                                        • Aurangzeb hopes to secure additional funding from IMF’s climate resiliency fund
                                        • Hints at drop in benchmark rate in SBP meeting
                                        
                                        WASHINGTON: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has described that China’s initial response to Pakistan’s request for extended debt maturities related to the Belt and Road Initiative as positive and encouraging.
                                        
                                        Speaking to US media and at think tank events, Mr Aurangzeb suggested that Pakistan might achieve greater debt flexibility as it manages the burden of past borrowing. He emphasised the necessity of comprehensive structural reforms, as required by the recent $7 billion loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
                                        
                                        Mr Aurangzeb is currently in Washington to participate in the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. During his visit, he has also engaged in bilateral discussions with US officials and finance ministers from allied nations.
                                        
                                        At an event hosted by Jihad Azour, IMF’s Director for the Middle East and Central Asia, Mr Aurangzeb identified key priorities, including broadening the tax base, reforming the energy sector, and privatising State-Owned Enterprises (SEOs).
                                        
                                        
                                        In an interview with Bloomberg, the finance minister highlighted efforts to extend the maturities on debts tied to power plants to “create enough space” for reducing electricity costs. He noted electricity prices had already surged, surpassing housing costs for some residents. “We have just started that discussion and the response is encouraging,” he said, adding that negotiations were still in the early stages. He had previously addressed the issue during a visit to China in July.
                                        
                                        During meetings with financial experts, lenders, and bankers, the Pakistani delegation emphasised that the country had entered a phase of relative stability, following the approval of the new $7bn IMF programme. They also mentioned that China had rolled over $16bn of the around $26bn in debt due this fiscal year, which began in July.
                                        
                                        
                                        The finance minister informed Bloomberg that Pakistan must maintain fiscal discipline to increase the tax-to-GDP ratio from under 10 per cent to 13.5pc, with the aim of reducing future dependence on IMF loans. Pakistan has had 25 IMF programmes to date, making it one of the most frequent borrowers.
                                        
                                        Instead of seeking new loans, Mr Aurangzeb expressed the hope to secure additional funding from the IMF’s climate resiliency fund during his Washington visit. He also highlighted the government’s economic stabilisation measures, noting that State Bank of Pakistan has cut its benchmark interest rate by 450 basis points over three consecutive meetings, reducing it to 17.5pc from 22pc. He hinted that the next SBP meeting, scheduled for Nov 4, might bring another rate cut.
                                        
                                        He also attended a meeting with IMF’s Managing Director, alongside finance ministers, central bank governors, and regional financial institution leaders from the Middle East and North Africa. He emphasised the integration of social protection measures into IMF lending frameworks and called for more financing directed at climate resilience.
                                        
                                        
                                        During these meetings, the finance minister advocated for increased debt relief mechanisms and concessional financing for vulnerable countries. He also backed the inclusion of challenges like climate risks, domestic public debt, and complex debt restructuring in the review of the Low-Income Countries Debt Sustainability Framework (LIC-DSF).
                                        
                                        At a roundtable discussion with institutional investors organised by Jefferies International, Mr Auran­gzeb highlighted Pakistan’s favourable economic indicators, crediting the successful stand-by arrangement with the IMF. He outlined government’s reform priorities, focusing on raising the tax-to-GDP ratio, cutting losses in the energy sector, improving governance in State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), accelerating privatisation, and controlling spending through federal government downsizing.
                                        
                                        In another meeting, Mr Aurangzeb briefed US Assistant Secretary for the Treasury Brent Nieman on key reforms, expressing gratitude for US support in securing Pakistan’s IMF Extended Fund Facility.
                                        
                                        At Washington’s Wilson Center, Mr Aurangzeb stressed the need to “fix our energy equation” and expand the tax net to include currently untaxed or undertaxed sectors. He warned, “We cannot get onto a sustainable growth path unless” these reforms are achieved.
                                        
                                        He also urged a shift in the economic model, stating: “The reason why we had so many boom and bust cycles… is that the DNA of our economy so far has been import-led and import-dependent. We have to change the DNA of the economy towards export-led growth.”

            <p>An AI system developed by Meta can find solutions to maths problems that have eluded mathematicians for over a century, researchers at the firm claim.

                The problems involve mathematical tools called Lyapunov functions, named after mathematician Aleksandr Lyapunov, which analyse whether a system will remain stable over time, meaning its behaviour can be predicted. One famous example of such a system is the motion of three celestial bodies as a result of their mutual gravitational interactions – describing the behaviour of this “three-body problem” is extremely challenging.

                <p>Wireless data has been sent at 938 gigabits per second, or more than 9000 times the average speed of a current 5G phone connection. This would be the equivalent of downloading more than 20 average-length movies a second. The speed is a record for multiplex data – where two or more signals are mixed.

                    The weight of demand for wireless signal at large gatherings like concerts and sports games and at busy train stations often causes mobile phone networks to grind to a halt. This is mainly because of the limited bandwidth within which 5G networks operate. The part of the electromagnetic spectrum now allocated to 5G networks varies from country to country, but generally occupies relatively low frequencies below 6 gigahertz, and then only narrow bands of frequencies.
                    
                    To boost transmission rates, Zhixin Liu at University College London and his colleagues have used a wider range of frequencies than in any previous experiment of its sort: all the way from 5 gigahertz to 150 gigahertz, using radio waves and light.

<p>KARACHI: Most economists believe the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) will reduce its policy rate by 200 basis points in its upcoming November meeting, marking the fourth consecutive cut since June, thanks to a decline in inflation, a low current account deficit and higher remittances.

    The previous three cuts have collectively lowered the benchmark interest rate by 450 basis points, bringing it down to 17.5 per cent from an unprecedented high of 22pc.
    
    However, despite this major cut, the economy has not shown strong signs of recovery. Growth expectations remain subdued, with forecasts not exceeding 3.2pc, while the large-scale manufacturing (LSM) sector recorded negative growth during the first two months of FY25.
    
    Experts suggest that the sharp decline in inflation is the key reason behind the downward trend in interest rates. Still, many argue that the economy requires more substantial cuts to stimulate trade and industrial activity. Trade and industry representatives have been calling for a reduction in the interest rate to around 10pc, slightly above the inflation rate.</p>
